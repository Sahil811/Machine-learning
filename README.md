# Machine-learning

Setup
The code was developed using Python 3.6 and requires commonly used data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.

To set up:

Clone the repository
Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts
Usage
The notebooks contain explanations and walkthroughs of the code. They can be run end-to-end to demonstrate machine learning workflows.

The Python scripts can be executed like regular Python programs.

Both notebooks and scripts are configured to load sample data, train models, and make predictions. They can be modified and adapted as needed.
